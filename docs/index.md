Rostruct is a [Promise](https://eryn.io/roblox-lua-promise/)-based file execution library written using [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com/).
This module allows you to build and deploy modular projects as Roblox instances in your
exploit of choice. The file conversion model is nearly identical to [Rojo's](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo#readme).

## Key Features

Rostruct enables:

* Quality readability, debugging, and maintainability in your projects
* Deploying projects {@link GitFetch directly from Github}
* Loading ``rbxm`` and ``rbxmx`` models into your project
* Building and deploying your project directly from your executor of choice
